TLDR: If you are reporting an issue, please use the issue template.

I provide an issue template so that I get all necessary information right away and can more quickly address any problems.  It wastes a lot of time when I have to ask for more information for a specific issue.

So, an issue is reported that does not follow the template, it will be marked invalid.  I do this to hopefully save time in the long run.
